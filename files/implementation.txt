ip address : 

"SecondaryIPAddresses": null,
            "IPAddress": "",
                    "IPAddress": "172.21.0.4",


steps of implementations:


PHASE 0 — What You Are Building (1 minute)

You will build:

✅ Suricata IDS (security mechanism)
✅ Docker-based lab
✅ 3 attack scenarios
✅ Visualization of alerts
✅ Report + presentation

PHASE 1 — Prepare Your Environment
Step 1: Install Required Tools

Make sure you have:

Docker

Docker Compose

Check:

docker --version
docker compose version


If missing → install Docker Desktop.

PHASE 2 — Create Project Structure
Step 2: Create Project Folder
mkdir network-security-project
cd network-security-project

Step 3: Create Folder Structure
mkdir suricata attacker webserver kibana
touch docker-compose.yml


Your structure:

network-security-project/
│── docker-compose.yml
│── suricata/
│── attacker/
│── webserver/
│── kibana/

PHASE 3 — Docker Network & Services
Step 4: Create docker-compose.yml

This is the core of your project.

version: "3.8"

services:

  web:
    image: nginx
    container_name: webserver
    networks:
      - security_net

  attacker:
    image: kalilinux/kali-rolling
    container_name: attacker
    tty: true
    networks:
      - security_net

  suricata:
    image: jasonish/suricata
    container_name: suricata
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - NET_RAW
    networks:
      - security_net
    volumes:
      - ./suricata/logs:/var/log/suricata

networks:
  security_net:
    driver: bridge

Step 5: Start Everything
docker compose up -d


Verify:

docker ps


You should see 3 containers running.

PHASE 4 — Configure Suricata IDS
Step 6: Enter Suricata Container
docker exec -it suricata bash

Step 7: Run Suricata in IDS Mode
suricata -i eth0


📌 Suricata now monitors all traffic on the Docker network.

PHASE 5 — Identify Target IP
Step 8: Get Web Server IP
docker inspect webserver | grep IPAddress


Save this IP (you’ll use it for attacks).

PHASE 6 — Attack Scenarios (MANDATORY)
Attack 1 — Network Scanning (Nmap)
Step 9: Enter Attacker Container
docker exec -it attacker bash


Install tools:

apt update
apt install -y nmap hping3 curl


Run scan:

nmap -sS WEB_SERVER_IP


✅ Suricata should detect scanning.

Attack 2 — Denial of Service (DoS-style)
Step 10: Run SYN Flood
hping3 -S --flood -p 80 WEB_SERVER_IP


Let it run 10–15 seconds, then stop with Ctrl+C.

Attack 3 — Suspicious HTTP Access
Step 11: Unauthorized Access Attempt
curl http://WEB_SERVER_IP/admin
curl http://WEB_SERVER_IP/login


These simulate abnormal access patterns.

PHASE 7 — View Alerts & Logs (Visualization)
Step 12: View Suricata Logs

Exit attacker, then:

cat suricata/logs/eve.json


You will see:

Attack type

Source IP

Destination IP

Timestamp

📸 Take screenshots of:

Scan alerts

DoS alerts

HTTP alerts

These screenshots are mandatory for the report.

PHASE 8 — Analyze Results (For Report)

For each attack, write:

Attack objective

Tool used

Alert generated

Evidence (screenshot)

Example:

Suricata successfully detected SYN flood traffic and generated multiple alerts indicating possible DoS activity.

PHASE 9 — Write the Report (Follow This Exactly)

Use this structure word-for-word:

Introduction and Objectives

Selected Security Mechanism (Suricata IDS)

System Architecture and Deployment

Configuration Details

Attack Scenarios and Testing

Visualization and Alert Analysis

Results and Observations

Limitations and Evasion Considerations

Conclusion and Lessons Learned

📌 Insert screenshots in sections 5 & 6.

PHASE 10 — Presentation

Create 6–8 slides:

Problem Statement

Tool Selection

Architecture Diagram

Attack Demonstrations

Alerts & Visualization

Results

Limitations

Conclusion

PHASE 11 — Final Checklist (Before Submission)

✔ Uses open-source tool
✔ Uses network-layer security
✔ Docker-based deployment
✔ At least 3 attack scenarios
✔ Logs + visualization
✔ Screenshots included
✔ Clear evaluation & limitations
